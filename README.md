# Timeline

**An iPhone app to track your notes, bookmarks, tasks and habits.**

The Timeline app makes it easy to keep track of your thoughts, ideas and habits.
With the ability to use hashtags, mention your contacts, and the ability to
create custom activity types, you can use it to track for almost everything,
from your tasks to how many cigarettes you smoke per day.

## Development

Simply clone the repo, open `timeline.xcworkspace` in Xcode, and run it!

If you need to update dependencies, change the `Podfile` and run `pod update`.


## Progress

At some point I'll probably release this app in the App Store, but before
that happens, the following things need to be completed:

- [ ] Manage custom activity types
- [ ] Onboarding view explaining how to use the app
- [ ] Search

There's also some nice-to-haves:

- [ ] Fix iCloud sync
- [ ] Tap on contact name to see contact card
- [ ] Tap on hashtag to filter by label
- [ ] Weekly overview of counts per activity type


## Contributing

I'd love it if you want to collaborate on this app! Since I have a relatively
clear vision for this app, it might be helpful however if you first open an
issue so that we can discuss any changes or additions you might be planning to
make.
